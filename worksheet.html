<h2 style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;">Activity 1</h2>

<p>
In this activity we will use the Orbit Simulator to discover the relationship
between how long it takes a planet to go around the Sun and how far away that
planet is from the Sun. This is also called Kepler's Third Law.
<ol>
  <li>Adjust the Planet's semi-major axis using the Semi Major Axis slider.
  Note the units of the semi-major axis. What happens when you increase the
  distance between the planet and the Sun?
  </li>
  <li> Using the graph of position versus time in the orbit simulator, measure
    the period of your planet for at least 10 different semi major axis values.
    Make sure to evenly space out your semi major axis choices on the slider.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make a plot of Period vs Semi Major Axis with the data you've collected.
    What does this tell you about the relationship between period and semi-major
    axis? Is it a linear relationship? Why or why not?
  </li>
  <li>
    Next make a plot of the square of the period vs the cube of the semi-major
    axis. Does this graph describe a linear relationship?
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, make a plot of the logarithm of period versus the logarithm of semi-
    major axis. What is the slope of this line and how does this connect to the
    previous question?
  </li>
  <li>
    What is Kepler's Third Law from your data?
  </li>

</ol>

</p>

<h2 style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;">Activity 2</h2>
For this activity we will explore the shape of the planet's orbit, and how the
planet's eccentricity affects it.

<ol>
  <li>
    Adjust the eccentricity of the planet using the eccentricity slider. How does
    this change the orbit? What shape is this?
  </li>
  <li>
    How does the planet's speed change during the course of an orbit?
  </li>
  <li>
    Using the velocity versus position graph, what is the ratio of the speed of
    the planet at closest approach (periapse), to farther approach (apoapse)?
  </li>
</ol>


<h2 style="font-size:20px; text-align:center;">Activity 3</h2>
In this final activity we will be looking at the effects of varying the planet's
mass.
<ol>
  <li>
    What happens as you increase the planet's mass? Does anything interesting happen
    to the Sun?
  </li>
  <li>
    What do you think the Sun is orbiting?
  </li>
</ol>
